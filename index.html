<h2>Fall Semester at UGA for Isabel Arenas</h2>
<h1><img src="AmScJ-Dx_400x400.jpg" alt="Isabel Arenas" height="300" width="300" style="float:left; border:5px solid black"></h1>
<p>
Hello, my name is Isabel Arenas, and I am a first-year here at UGA. I am an intended Fiance Major, so my classes reflect that.
In high school, I completed the majority of my core classes, so I am able to jump straight into the required classes I need to get into Terry.
So far, I am enjoying my classes, and I like being here at UGA!<br> <br> Below, you see my Monday/Wednesday schedule.</p>
<table style= "background-color:white" cellspacing="5px" border="5" class="center">
<tr><th colspan=2>Schedule</th></tr>
<tr><td>9:05<td>Weather/Climate
<tr><td>10:10<td>English 1102
<tr><td>11:15<td>Microeconomics
<tr><td>12:20<td>Computing Lab
<tr><td>1:25<td>Computing
</table>
<p>
In addition to classes, I am also involved in theater here at UGA. I was just in the university's main stage production of 
<i>Cabaret</i> in the 
<abbr title="Fine Arts Building">FAB</abbr>.
This show ran from November 3-12. We did seven public performances and one school show.
In preparation for this production, we rehearsed roughly 30 hours a week as the show got closer. It was a lot of time and work, but it definitely paid off. Below is a link to the review The Red and Black did on the show.

<p>
As well as classes and <i>Cabaret</i>, I also have been working. I babysit four days of the week, and I teach a class at Above Barre. I have always loved kids, so I enjoy babysitting a lot. My class at Above Barre requires more preparation and energy.
I wake up early and plan in order to give the people the best workout possible. This job is a good way to stay in shape while making a little money. While working and doing school I want to maintain some goals. You see these goals below.
</p>
<ul><li>All A's</li><li>At least 7 hours of sleep a night</li><li>Keep a certain amount of money in my account</li></ul>
<p> In summation, my first semester of college has been extremely busy but definitely fun and fulfilling. I look forward to the next three and half years at UGA as this semester comes to a close. GO DAWGS!
